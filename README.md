# Packosphere

A community built and maintained alternative to [Atmosphere](http://atmospherejs.com). Initially created with ðŸ–¤ by [@copleykj](https://github.com/copleykj).

## Why
Packosphere

Why
Since its creation by [Percolate Studios](http://percolatestudio.com/), Atmosphere has been closed source, and the community was unable to explore the code, fix its bugs, or create new and awesome features. It remained in this state even after being acquired by MDG as well as Tiny's acquisition of Meteor.

Packosphere is the realization of a dream to have an open and transparent Package explorer for Meteor packages. Its source is yours to inspect and modify, and you are fully welcome to get involved with creating new innovative features or fixing its bugs.

## Development

> When you first clone and run this repo, it will start to sync the Meteor package database to the local database. This will take a non trivial amount of time (from 30 minutes to upwards of 1.5 hours). You'll probably wanna go get a cup of coffee, or 3, and come back.

1. Configure editor by making sure eslint and editor-config is installed.
2. Clone this repository.

   ```sh

   ```
```sh
Copy code
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/Packosphere.git
Create a settings.json file containing an empty object.

```sh
Copy code

## Install NPM dependencies including Tailwind CSS, Autoprefixer, and PostCSS PurgeCSS. Ensure that Tailwind CSS is upgraded to version 3.4.3.
```sh
Copy code

## meteor npm install tailwindcss@3.4.3 autoprefixer @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss --save-dev

## Updating the Footer with the Current Year
## To dynamically display the current year in the footer, ensure you have updated the footer component to include currentYear. This typically involves using JavaScript's new Date().getFullYear() to get the current year. And add github icon and link.

3. ## Create settings.json file containing an empty object

   
   ```sh
   echo {} > settings.json
   ```

4. Install NPM dependencies.

   ``````sh
   meteor npm i
   ```

5. Start the app.

   ``````sh
   npm start
